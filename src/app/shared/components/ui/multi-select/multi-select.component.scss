// --- NEW STYLE RULE ---
// This targets the pseudo-checkbox that Angular Material adds to mat-option
// and hides it, so it doesn't overlap or appear next to our real mat-checkbox.
// Using ::ng-deep is necessary here because the pseudo-checkbox is created
// inside the mat-option's encapsulated view, which our component's styles
// can't normally reach.
